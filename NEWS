NEWS & BUGS 


2013-Sept-26 
	enabled decoding from FLDIGI data feed. clamping x value to 1.0 max as FLDIGI sends values over 20.0 during startup before AGC kicks in.
	BUG: P(dah) abruptly goes from near 1.0 down and the bounces back => P(max) jumps to huge values 
	too long dahs?  
	
2013-Sept-25 
	BUG: missing word space /pause between words QUICK BROWN  when < 30 db SNR ?
	FOUND: enabled  noise.c processing in morse.c 
	changed to: 
			noise_(&x, &rn, &zout);
			retstat = proces_(&zout, &rn, &xhat, &px, &elmhat, &spdhat, &imax, &pmax);
	much better decoding with low SNR test signals.

2013-Sept-25  
	run "./morse t test/test20db.in | less"
	BUG: QUICD  and FOB  when high 20 dB SNR?  
	D should be K  and  B should be X 
	for some reason last 'dah' following word space gets decoded as 'dit'.
	FOUND:  Initl.c - line 123    1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,   // mauri 2013-09-25 bugfix
	had 0 instead of 1 in state k=4
