This software is a Morse decoder orinally created by Dr. E. L. Bell in 1977.  
The software was manually entered from Fortran program listings and later converted to C++. 

2013-SEP-01  	Initial version. Compiled with  gfortran -g  produces a.out. Based on initial testing the 
		element state estimation works, but translating letters has still problems. Produces a sequence 
		of letter states but translation to actual characters produces incorrect letters.
